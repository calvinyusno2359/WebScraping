Kiki Lee,a year ago,5,"Dear Jerry, as a medical clinic we take feedback seriously. We are sorry if you medical condition has not been improved after treatment, however in most of the medical treatment we required mutual feedback from patient in order to plan for the most effective treatment. It is virtually impossible to treat all diseases in one visiting and follow up is usually required. For your information, cost of medical fees including medication are regulated by ministry of health malaysia, we suggest you to feedback to our staffs immediately regarding the charges if you think it is not appropriate, this helps the doctors to plan for alternate medication if required.
