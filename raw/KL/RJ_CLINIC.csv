Ni Yun Chia,2 years ago,5,"Dear Ivy, thank you for taking your time to leave us a constructive review.

It is of utmost importance every patient is satisfied with our treatment and service and we feel very sad you did not like our work and only inform us after 1 year of injection.

RJ CLINIC was established 6 years ago and have treated more than 4000 happy patients. Most of them are being injected  with fillers to improve their appearance such as chin, under eye, forehead, cheeks and of course the nose. 

With the trust of many Malaysians, we were awarded the highest number of filler injected in Malaysia for 2018 & 2019 consecutively (Merz Golden Award 2018 & 2019). We couldn't have done that if patients did not place trust in our doctors' injection skill.

It is glad to hear that you love the skincare that we carry as well as it managed to improve your skin condition with it. As we do not know how other establishments price their products, at RJ CLINIC we do believe in good products at most reasonable pricing. Hence we always recommend a package price. 

For non-surgical nose augmentation, apart from filler nose augmentation, we do have other options to cater to your case. We feel that it is only right for us to make things right for you despite the one year gap of treatment time. 

Do let us know when you drop by next time and we can plan your treatment again to cater to your specific needs.",64,4.6
